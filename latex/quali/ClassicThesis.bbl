  Models of protein energetics that neglect interactions between amino acids
  that are not adjacent in the native state, such as the Go model, encode or
  underlie many influential ideas on protein folding. Implicit in this
  simplification is a crucial assumption that has never been critically
  evaluated in a broad context: Detailed mechanisms of protein folding are not
  biased by nonnative contacts, typically argued to be a consequence of
  sequence design and/or topology. Here we present, using computer simulations
  of a well-studied lattice heteropolymer model, the first systematic test of
  this oft-assumed correspondence over the statistically significant range of
  hundreds of thousands of amino acid sequences that fold to the same native
  structure. Contrary to previous conjectures, we find a multiplicity of
  folding mechanisms, suggesting that Go-like models cannot be justified by
  considerations of topology alone. Instead, we find that the crucial factor in
  discriminating among topological pathways is the heterogeneity of native
  contact energies: The order in which native contacts accumulate is profoundly
  insensitive to omission of nonnative interactions, provided that native
  contact heterogeneity is retained. This robustness holds over a surprisingly
  wide range of folding rates for our designed sequences. Mirroring predictions
  based on the principle of minimum frustration, fast-folding sequences match
  their Go-like counterparts in both topological mechanism and transit times.
  Less optimized sequences dwell much longer in the unfolded state and/or
  off-pathway intermediates than do Go-like models. For dynamics that bridge
  unfolded and unfolded states, however, even slow folders exhibit topological
  mechanisms and transit times nearly identical with those of their Go-like
  counterparts. Our results do not imply a direct correspondence between
  folding trajectories of Go-like models and those of real proteins, but they
  do help to clarify key topological and energetic assumptions that are
  commonly used to justify such caricatures%

  Attempts to answer the Levinthal question ``How proteins fold to give such a
  unique structure'' are discussed. In the first part of this article, we focus
  on a few reasons as to why the solution to the protein-folding problem (PFP)
  has been elusive for a very long time. One is a result of the
  misinterpretation of Anfinsen's Thermodynamic hypothesis which led to the
  conclusion that the native structure of a protein must be at a global minimum
  of the Gibbs energy. The second is the result of the adherence to the
  hydrophobic paradigm, and at the same time ignoring a whole repertoire of
  hydrophilic effects. It is argued that switching from a target-based to a
  caused-based approach, and adopting the hydrophilic paradigm leads
  straightforwardly to a simple answer to Levinthal's question, as well as to a
  solution of the PFP%

  This article is an introduction to the special issue of the journal PROTEINS,
  dedicated to the tenth Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP)
  experiment to assess the state of the art in protein structure modeling. The
  article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories of prediction
  included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment procedures. The 10 CASP
  experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein
  structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and
  model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained
  improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For
  the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of
  sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be
  obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the
  other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable
  promise, have yet to make an impact in CASP testing. The nature of CASP
  targets has been changing in recent CASPs, reflecting shifts in experimental
  structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and
  multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When
  allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in
  the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of
  non-template regions%

  Protein structure prediction is one of the major challenges in bioinformatics
  today. Throughout the past five decades, many different algorithmic
  approaches have been attempted, and although progress has been made the
  problem remains unsolvable even for many small proteins. While the general
  objective is to predict the three-dimensional structure from primary
  sequence, our current knowledge and computational power are simply
  insufficient to solve a problem of such high complexity. Some prediction
  algorithms do, however, appear to perform better than others, although it is
  not always obvious which ones they are and it is perhaps even less obvious
  why that is. In this review, the reported performance results from 18
  different recently published prediction algorithms are compared. Furthermore,
  the general algorithmic settings most likely responsible for the difference
  in the reported performance are identified, and the specific settings of each
  of the 18 prediction algorithms are also compared. The average normalized
  r.m.s.d. scores reported range from 11.17 to 3.48. With a performance measure
  including both r.m.s.d. scores and CPU time, the currently best-performing
  prediction algorithm is identified to be the I-TASSER algorithm. Two of the
  algorithmic settings--protein representation and fragment assembly--were
  found to have definite positive influence on the running time and the
  predicted structures, respectively. There thus appears to be a clear benefit
  from incorporating this knowledge in the design of new prediction algorithms%

  Sequence comparison is a major step in the prediction of protein structure
  from existing templates in the Protein Data Bank. The identification of
  potentially remote homologues to be used as templates for modeling target
  sequences of unknown structure and their accurate alignment remain
  challenges, despite many years of study. The most recent advances have been
  in combining as many sources of information as possible--including amino acid
  variation in the form of profiles or hidden Markov models for both the target
  and template families, known and predicted secondary structures of the
  template and target, respectively, the combination of structure alignment for
  distant homologues and sequence alignment for close homologues to build
  better profiles, and the anchoring of certain regions of the alignment based
  on existing biological data. Newer technologies have been applied to the
  problem, including the use of support vector machines to tackle the fold
  classification problem for a target sequence and the alignment of hidden
  Markov models. Finally, using the consensus of many fold recognition methods,
  whether based on profile-profile alignments, threading or other approaches,
  continues to be one of the most successful strategies for both recognition
  and alignment of remote homologues. Although there is still room for
  improvement in identification and alignment methods, additional progress may
  come from model building and refinement methods that can compensate for large
  structural changes between remotely related targets and templates, as well as
  for regions of misalignment%

  The pattern of residue substitution in divergently evolving families of
  globular proteins is highly variable. At each position in a fold there are
  constraints on the identities of amino acids from both the three-dimensional
  structure and the function of the protein. To characterize and quantify the
  structural constraints, we have made a comparative analysis of families of
  homologous globular proteins. Residues are classified according to amino acid
  type, secondary structure, accessibility of the sidechain, and existence of
  hydrogen bonds from sidechain to other sidechains or peptide carbonyl or
  amide functions. There are distinct patterns of substitution especially where
  residues are both solvent inaccessible and hydrogen bonded through their
  sidechains. The patterns of residue substitution can be used to construct
  templates or to identify 'key' residues if one or more structures are known.
  Conversely, analysis of conversation and substitution across a large family
  of aligned sequences in terms of substitution profiles can allow prediction
  of tertiary environment or indicate a functional role. Similar analyses can
  be used to test the validity of putative structures if several homologous
  sequences are available%

  As more and more protein structures are determined, there is increasing
  interest in the question of how many different folds have been used in
  biology. The history of the rate of discovery of new folds and the
  distribution of sequence families among known folds provide a means of
  estimating the underlying distribution of fold use. Previous models
  exploiting these data have led to rather different conclusions on the total
  number of folds. We present a new model, based on the notion that the folds
  used in biology fall naturally into three classes: unifolds, that is, folds
  found only in a single narrow sequence family; mesofolds, found in an
  intermediate number of families; and the previously noted superfolds, found
  in many protein families. We show that this model fits the available data
  well and has predicted the development of SCOP over the past 2 years. The
  principle implications of the model are as follows: (1) The vast majority of
  folds will be found in only a single sequence family; (2) the total number of
  folds is at least 10,000; and (3) 80\% of sequence families have one of about
  400 folds, most of which are already known%

  In the fifty years since the first atomic structure of a protein was
  revealed, tens of thousands of additional structures have been solved. Like
  all objects in biology, proteins structures show common patterns that seem to
  define family relationships. Classification of proteins structures, which
  started in the 1970s with about a dozen structures, has continued with
  increasing enthusiasm, leading to two main fold classifications, SCOP and
  CATH, as well as many additional databases. Classification is complicated by
  deciding what constitutes a domain, the fundamental unit of structure. Also
  difficult is deciding when two given structures are similar. Like all of
  biology, fold classification is beset by exceptions to all rules. Thus, the
  perspectives of protein fold space that the fold classifications offer differ
  from each other. In spite of these ambiguities, fold classifications are
  useful for prediction of structure and function. Studying the characteristics
  of fold space can shed light on protein evolution and the physical laws that
  govern protein behavior%

  proteins sharing the same fold but different sequence. The recent design of
  proteins displaying very high sequence identities but different 3D structure
  allows the unique opportunity to address the protein-folding problem from a
  complementary perspective. Here we explored by ?-value analysis the pathways
  of folding of three different heteromorphic pairs, displaying increasingly
  high-sequence identity (namely, 30\%, 77\%, and 88\%), but different
  structures called G(A) (a 3-? helix fold) and G(B) (an ?/? fold). The
  analysis, based on 132 site-directed mutants, is fully consistent with the
  idea that protein topology is committed very early along the pathway of
  folding. Furthermore, data reveals that when folding approaches a perfect
  two-state scenario, as in the case of the G(A) domains, the structural
  features of the transition state appear very robust to changes in sequence
  composition. On the other hand, when folding is more complex and multistate,
  as for the G(B)s, there are alternative nuclei or accessible pathways that
  can be alternatively stabilized by altering the primary structure. The
  implications of our results in the light of previous work on the folding of
  different members belonging to the same protein family are discussed%

  We have developed an automatic algorithm STRIDE for protein secondary
  structure assignment from atomic coordinates based on the combined use of

  Comparison to the currently most widely used technique DSSP by Kabsch and

  secondary structural states in 58 and 31\% of 226 protein chains in our data
  sample, respectively, in greater agreement with the specific
  residue-by-residue definitions provided by the discoverers of the structures
  while in 11\% of the chains, the assignments are the same. STRIDE delineates
  every 11th helix and every 32nd strand more in accord with published

  BACKGROUND: A number of methods are now available to perform automatic
  assignment of periodic secondary structures from atomic coordinates, based on
  different characteristics of the secondary structures. In general these
  methods exhibit a broad consensus as to the location of most helix and strand
  core segments in protein structures. However the termini of the segments are
  often ill-defined and it is difficult to decide unambiguously which residues
  at the edge of the segments have to be included. In addition, there is a
  ``twilight zone'' where secondary structure segments depart significantly
  from the idealized models of Pauling and Corey. For these segments, one has
  to decide whether the observed structural variations are merely distorsions
  or whether they constitute a break in the secondary structure. METHODS: To
  address these problems, we have developed a method for secondary structure
  assignment, called KAKSI. Assignments made by KAKSI are compared with
  assignments given by DSSP, STRIDE, XTLSSTR, PSEA and SECSTR, as well as
  secondary structures found in PDB files, on 4 datasets (X-ray structures with
  different resolution range, NMR structures). RESULTS: A detailed comparison
  of KAKSI assignments with those of STRIDE and PSEA reveals that KAKSI assigns
  slightly longer helices and strands than STRIDE in case of one-to-one
  correspondence between the segments. However, KAKSI tends also to favor the
  assignment of several short helices when STRIDE and PSEA assign longer,
  kinked, helices. Helices assigned by KAKSI have geometrical characteristics
  close to those described in the PDB. They are more linear than helices
  assigned by other methods. The same tendency to split long segments is
  observed for strands, although less systematically. We present a number of
  cases of secondary structure assignments that illustrate this behavior.
  CONCLUSION: Our method provides valuable assignments which favor the
  regularity of secondary structure segments%

  A physical theory of protein secondary structure is proposed and tested by
  performing exceedingly simple Monte Carlo simulations. In essence, secondary
  structure propensities are predominantly a consequence of two competing local
  effects, one favoring hydrogen bond formation in helices and turns, the other
  opposing the attendant reduction in sidechain conformational entropy on helix
  and turn formation. These sequence specific biases are densely dispersed
  throughout the unfolded polypeptide chain, where they serve to preorganize
  the folding process and largely, but imperfectly, anticipate the native
  secondary structure%

  \field{abstract}{%
  Protein sequences can be represented as binary patterns of polar (○) and
  nonpolar ({\textbullet}) amino acids. These binary sequence patterns are
  categorized into two classes: Class A patterns match the structural repeat of
  an idealized amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix (3.6 residues per turn), and class B
  patterns match the structural repeat of an idealized amphiphilic
  $\beta$-strand (2 residues per turn). The difference between these two
  classes of sequence patterns has led to a strategy for de novo protein design
  based on binary patterning of polar and nonpolar amino acids. Here we ask
  whether similar binary patterning is incorporated in the sequences and
  structures of natural proteins. Analysis of the Protein Data Bank
  demonstrates the following. (1) Class A sequence patterns occur considerably
  more frequently in the sequences of natural proteins than would be expected
  at random, but class B patterns occur less often than expected. (2) Each
  pattern is found predominantly in the secondary structure expected from the
  binary strategy for protein design. Thus, class A patterns are found more
  frequently in $\alpha$-helices than in $\beta$-strands, and class B patterns
  are found more frequently in $\beta$-strands than in $\alpha$-helices. (3)
  Among the $\alpha$-helices of natural proteins, the most commonly used binary
  patterns are indeed the class A patterns. (4) Among all $\beta$-strands in
  the database, the most commonly used binary patterns are not the expected
  class B patterns. (5) However, for solvent-exposed $\beta$-strands, the
  correlation is striking: All $\beta$-strands in the database that contain the
  class B patterns are exposed to solvent. (6) The bias of class A patterns for
  $\alpha$-structure over $\beta$-structure and the bias of class B patterns
  for $\beta$-structure over $\alpha$-structure are significant, not merely
  when compared to other binary patterns of polar (○) and nonpolar
  ({\textbullet}) amino acids, but also when compared to the full range of
  sequences in the database. The implications for the design of novel proteins
  are discussed.%
